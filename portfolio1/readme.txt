Portfolio 1
For this project, I redo Lab 2, Lab 5, and Lab 6. Basically, this portfolio is about creating an interface that displays some Pokemon. Based on what I learned from Lab 6, I use useEffect and fetch to create an API request. I used the concept of Lab 2 to fetch data from the local API.  On the API, I created an express server and a route (/api/team) that serves files from a module. Finally, I used express.static to serves file from the omg directory. 

Directory: 
All files are included in a folder called portfolio1 (https://github.com/Wacore/DIG4503-BackEnd/tree/main/portfolio1). The code of the back-end is in the folder called api, and the code of the front-end is in the folder called frontend/poke.
