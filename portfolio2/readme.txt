Portfolio 2
For this project, I redo Lab 10. Basically, this portfolio is about creating an interface that displays some employees. Based on what I learned from Lab 10, I use useEffect and fetch to create an API request. I used the concept of Lab 10 to fetch data from the local API.  On the API, I created an express server and a route that serves files from a module. 

Directory: 
All files are included in a folder called portfolio2 (https://github.com/Wacore/DIG4503-BackEnd/tree/main/portfolio2). The code of the back-end is in the file called index.js, and the code of the front-end is in the folder called client.
